    - service B (client service) -> transport
    - transport -> microservice B

rest-api:
  - controller (rest controller) -> service
  - service (client service) -> transport

transport: gateway <-> RMQ <-> microservice 

microservice A:
  - controler A (microservice controller) -> service

microservice B:
  - controler B (microservice controller) -> service
  - service B (typeorm service) -> typeorm-repo
